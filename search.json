    "text": "The 2024-2025 Oklahoma City Thunder weren’t only elite on defense. They played defense like they were pissed just seeing the other side try to score.\nThis wasn’t no small improvement. This wasn’t a “young team taking a step.” This was a team that shook things up in NBA history. And by the end of the season, one question kept resurfacing:\nDid we just watch the most dominant defense the NBA has ever seen?\nSpoiler alert: You could make that case, loudly.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\n\n\nturnovers &lt;- read_csv(\"Turnovers forced per game in the NBA - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nturnovers2024 &lt;- turnovers |&gt;\n  select(Team, \"2024\")\n\nOKC &lt;- turnovers |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Team == \"Okla City\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=turnovers2024, aes(x=reorder(Team,`2024`), weight= `2024`), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=OKC, aes(x=reorder(Team, `2024`), weight= `2024`), fill=\"blue\")  +\n  coord_flip() +\n    theme_minimal() +\nlabs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Turnovers forced per game\", \n    title=\"Chaos Is Their Game: Thunder Force the Most Turnovers\", \n    subtitle=\"Oklahoma City's league-leading turnovers forced per game show just how dominant their defense was.\", \n    caption=\"Source: TeamRankings | By Trey Stevens\"\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n  axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n  plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then the postseason arrived. Turns out the playoffs made their case even stronger.\nBut before the playoffs arrived, games showed exactly just how overwhelming OKC was, the regular season set the groundwork for what came next.\nThe Thunder didn’t just force mistakes, they forced them more than anyone. Their pressure turned simple actions into broken possessions. Their anticipation turned passes into turnovers. And their quickness in securing loose balls altered the game’s tempo.\n\n\nCode\nokc &lt;- c(\"Makes\"=37.9, \"Misses\"=49.1)\nbos &lt;- c(\"Makes\"=40.3, \"Misses\"=49.1)\ncle &lt;- c(\"Makes\"=41.2, \"Misses\"=49.7)\n\n\n\niron(\nwaffle(\n    okc,\n    rows = 5,\n    colors = c(\"black\", \"blue\")) +\n   labs(\n     x=\"Oklahoma City Thunder\",\n     title=\"The League's Coldest Nights Came Against Oklahoma City\", \n     subtitle=\"Opponents shot just 43.5% against the Thunder, the lowest rate among the \nNBA's top three defenses.\") + \n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\nwaffle(\n    bos,\n    rows = 5,\n    colors = c(\"black\", \"green\")) +\n    labs(\n     x=\"Boston Celtics\")\n,\nwaffle(\n    cle,\n    rows = 5,\n    colors = c(\"black\", \"darkred\")) +\n     labs(\n     x = \"Cleveland Cavavliers\\n1 square = 1 shot\",\n     caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Graphic by Trey Stevens\"\n     )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven when teams avoided turnovers, scoring against the Thunder remained a struggle. Oklahoma City’s rotations and relentless shot-contesting dropped opponents’ field goal percentage to the lowest in the league. Shot choices vanished, spacing was crowded, while floaters and layups were heavily contested. Every possession felt uncomfortable, as the Thunder dictated the pace and forced opponents into low-percentage shots at every single trip down the court.\n\n\nCode\ntov &lt;- read_csv(\"tovrank(in).csv\")\n\ntov |&gt; \n  select(RANK, TEAM, SEASON, `OPP TOV`) |&gt;\n  gt()|&gt;\n cols_label(\n    RANK = \"Rank\",\n    TEAM = \"Team\",\n    SEASON = \"Season\",\n    `OPP TOV` = \"Opponent Turnovers\",\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The Most Disruptive Playoff Defense Ever!\",\n    subtitle = \"The Thunder forced more turnovers than any team in NBA playoff history and it wasn’t close.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"By: Trey Stevens  | Source: statmuse\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n \n  data_color(\n    columns = vars(`OPP TOV`),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n      palette = c(\n        \"white\", \"orange\", \"red\"),\n      domain = NULL)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Disruptive Playoff Defense Ever!\n\n\nThe Thunder forced more turnovers than any team in NBA playoff history and it wasn’t close.\n\n\nRank\nTeam\nSeason\nOpponent Turnovers\n\n\n\n\n1\nThunder\n2024-25\n415\n\n\n2\nRaptors\n2018-19\n369\n\n\n3\nWarriors\n2015-16\n356\n\n\n4\nPacers\n2024-25\n323\n\n\n5\nWarriors\n2018-19\n323\n\n\n6\nCeltics\n2021-22\n319\n\n\n7\nHeat\n2022-23\n310\n\n\n8\nWarriors\n2021-22\n305\n\n\n9\nLakers\n2019-20\n305\n\n\n10\nBucks\n2020-21\n303\n\n\n\nBy: Trey Stevens | Source: statmuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe postseason usually exposes defensive pretenders. The game slows down, matchups get tighter, and good ball-handlers clean up their mistakes.\nBut that didn’t happen with the Thunder.\nTheir turnover pressure didn’t skip a beat. Everything they did in the regular season, jumping lanes, blowing up actions early, crowding the ball-handlers showed up again in the playoffs. Offenses were supposed to handle the pressure better that simply didn’t. Elite scorers got rushed. Passing angles disappeared. Set plays turned into scramble situations.\nThey weren’t just defending possessions. They were taking control of them, over and over again."
